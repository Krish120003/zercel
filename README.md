vercel clone

- [ ] isolated nodejs builder (docker? give it repo link, it builds and exports artifacts somewhere?)
- [ ] serve the build (nodejs runtime)
- [ ] route the build to right place (nginx? reverse proxy)
- [ ] make it work across multiple domains?

## Builder

The builder needs to take in a git repo clone somehow
and build it "automagically"
